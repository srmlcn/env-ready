# env-ready

**env-ready** is a schema-driven environment variable loader for Node.js projects, built with TypeScript and designed for extensibility.

At its core, **env-ready** aims to provide a minimal, fail-fast interface for validating and loading environment variables at startup. It is being developed with support for adapter-based integration with multiple schema validation libraries, allowing developers to use the tooling they prefer while maintaining configuration integrity.

## Goals

- Centralize environment variable validation and access
- Fail fast on missing or malformed variables
- Enable schema flexibility through pluggable adapters
- Keep the runtime overhead minimal and the API ergonomic
